# Computational Methods for Biomedical Image Analysis

## Introduction

This course introduces the basics and application of biomedical imaging in clinical scenarios to students without medical backgrounds, and previous application of computational methods including computer vision and machine learning in biomedical imaging will be also covered. I took this course in Spring 2021.

## Assignments
### I. Medical Image Segmentation
In this assignment, we will learn:

- Usage of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files
- Hounsfield Units
- CT Segmentation using thresholding algorithm
